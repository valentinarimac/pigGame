WARRNING: HTML and CSS are written by Jonas Schmedtmann (Javascript Course on Udemy), but the functionality was completely written by me!

Pig is a simple dice game. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
 - If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn
 - If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues
 - If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score ("current"), and it becomes the next player's turn
 - Originaly, the first player to score 100 or more points wins, but in this case it is 30 (for the simplicity)
